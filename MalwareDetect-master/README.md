Problem Statement:
Detect if an android app has malware using it's permission requirements.

Dataset source:
submitted by ANKIT BHARDWAJ on Kaggle.com
and liscesned under CC0: Public Domain

Analytic Sandbox:
we create a local environment in VSCode for research which is
abstracted from the live deployment.

Initial Dataset:
29,335 unique data entries,
86 Feature columns with permissions,
1 Result column with prediction 

ELT:
    Visualizing the data for outliers: Refer Image

Data Conditioning:
    Normalization & Transformation:
        Using the StandardScaler by sklearn:
            Mean of 0: After scaling, the mean (average) value of each feature (column) in your dataset will be 0. This is achieved by subtracting the mean of each feature from each data point in that feature.
            Standard Deviation of 1: After scaling, the standard deviation of each feature will be 1. This is achieved by dividing each data point in a feature by the standard deviation of that feature.

    (NOTE much transformation is not needed as data is in binary format)
